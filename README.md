# Advent Of Code 2021

Advent of Code is an Advent calendar of small programming puzzles for a variety of skill sets and skill levels that can be solved in any programming language you like.

Here are my solutions.

You can navigate into the folders and run each Swift file on its own, using `swift {filename}`.

Alternatively you can run them all together using the `all.sh` script in the root directory: `./all.sh`.


The original questions are available on the [Advent of Code website](https://adventofcode.com/2021).
